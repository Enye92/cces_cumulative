Directory for building a CCES cumulative file




# Where things are
- `data/source` is where all the input data is. Things in here should not be overwritten. Instead, manipulated output should go in `data/output`.
- `data/source/cces` stores all the CCES common content material.
- `data/source/census` stores all the census-related data, and so on.
- `guides` stores all the codebooks, guides, etc.. to explain the common content.
- `pettigrew_code` stores the code from Stephen Pettigrew that he used to create the 2006 - 2012 cumulative.
- `codebook` is where output related to question bank should go.
